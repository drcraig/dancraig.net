As a bit of a map and navigation geek, I was so enchanted with the [XKCD Now](http://xkcd.com/now) clock that I decided to make an actual one.

The clock is made from foamcore board, card stock printouts, and a 24 hour quartz movement that I ordered from [Klockit](http://www.klockit.com/products/dept-157__sku-aaaag.html).
