My name is Dan Craig. I'm an aerospace-turned-software engineer in Lexington, Massachusetts. I currently work at [Curata](http://www.curata.com) building content marketing software. Prior to that, I developed flight displays and navigation systems at [Avidyne](http://www.avidyne.com).

I serve as the alumni house corporation president of the [Alpha Theta chapter](http://sigmachi.mit.edu) of the Sigma Chi fraternity at MIT. I also volunteer at a local Boy Scout troop.

I love my family, especially [my wife](http://sallyhonda.com) and [son](http://huxleycraig.com). I love writing code and prose, building furniture, cooking good food, flying airplanes upside down, antique and modern houses, travelling, reading history, and listening to almost all genres of music.  I admire craftsmen of all kinds and relish any opportunity to learn from a master. I find the universe to be filled with endless mystery and countless puzzles to solve. I don't know why that is the case, or if there even is a reason why, but it sure is fun. I know enough to know that there's a lot that I don't konw. But I sure wish I did know it.

I went to MIT, but I use VIM. Go figure.
